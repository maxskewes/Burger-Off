# BURGER OFF!
### Â©2020
Burger Off! is an app designed with [Handlebars](handlebarsjs.com), utilizing the database [MySql], that allows users to choose from a list of burgers or design their won. They may then choose to "devour" that burger which would would move it from the left side of the screen to the right. There, the user is presented with two options, "regurgitate" or "digest". "Regurgitate" moves the burger back to it's undevoured state where "digest" removes the burger from the list and deletes it from the datatbase.
